		 * Escape!
		 * 
		 * you wake up in a cold damp room
		 * there is a dangling lamp hanging from the
		 * ceiling looking like its about the break free from it's
		 * hinges in the center of the room its bulb looks brand new
		 * there is a small box on the floor also in the center
		 * there are no doors
		 * there are no windows
		 * to the south there is an abnormal tile
		 * 
		 * (player opens box)
		 * inside the box you find a hammer
		 * + hammer, box
		 * 
		 * (player takes light bulb)
		 * it burns player's hands a bit
		 * the entire room goes dim
		 * your eyes adjust enough to the darkness
		 * there is a light eminating from an unknown source
		 * + bulb
		 * 
		 * (player goes south)
		 * the surrounding tiles are all a dull white color, this one,
		 * however, is the same color as the lamp
		 *
		 *		(player breaks tile with hammer)
		 *		the tile cracks immediately and shards of it fall everywhere
		 *		one piece is larger than the others and very sharp
		 *		behind the tile is a safe with a 4 letter code
		 *
		 *		(player takes tile shard)
		 *		the tile is dull enough on the sides to hold, but has
		 *		a sharp end
		 *
		 *		(player breaks safe with hammer or shard)
		 *		you slam your hammer into the safe, but it bounces back
		 *		with the safe seemingly unharmed
		 *	
		 * (player kills self with tile shard or hammer or gun)
		 * i guess that's one way to escape
		 * Ending 1: the easy way out
		 * 
		 * (player breaks bulb with hammer)
		 * the glass of the bulb explodes and shatters all over the floor
		 * a small roll of paper falls out of the light
		 * 
		 * 		(player takes paper)
		 * 		taken
		 * 
		 * 				(player reads paper)
		 * 				the paper has 8 lines of code in tiny writing
		 * 				you struggle to read it in the darkness but
		 *	 			after a few minutes you figure out what it says
		 * 
		 * 				char a = "a";
		 *  			char b = "b";
		 *  			int z12 = 12;
		 *  			
		 *  			if (z12 + 33 == 46) {
		 *  				System.out.print("two b's");
		 *  			} else {
		 *  				System.out.print("two a's"); 
		 *  
		 *  (player removes lamp)
		 *  you grab the hanging lamp and rip it off the wall
		 *  wires dangle from the ceiling from where it once was
		 *  ++ lamp
		 *  
		 *  		(player takes wires without stool)
		 *  		the wires are just barely too high for you to take
		 * 
		 * 			(player takes wires with stool)
		 * 			you reach up and take the wires out of the ceiling
		 * 			the ceiling crumbles as the wires are torn away, revealing
		 * 			the night sky
